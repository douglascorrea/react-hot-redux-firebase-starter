### Add by me : 
- Chat : single chat room
  There is only 1 chat room where users can discuss:
    - User must be connected or subscribe an account to access chat room
    - User can read the last 10 messages of the room when entering
    - User can read new messages from other users
    - User can write and send new messages
- FireBase : 
  I created an account and set the rules on public mode. Everybody can read and write on database (it's just a database for     this project).
- Problem :
    - The input field to write a message doesn't reset after submit.
    - The TalkBox does update only for our messages.
    - For this updates, it's obligatory to refresh window.
