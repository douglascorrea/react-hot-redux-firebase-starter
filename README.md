bjorge-irc
=====================

bjorge-irc is as simple chat webapp. So, basically, you can chat with your friends with it.

## Informations

### About

The project is based on the [Firebase 3.0 Starter using React Redux](https://github.com/douglascorrea/react-hot-redux-firebase-starter) boilerplate by [@douglascorrea](https://github.com/douglascorrea).

For now, it doesn't do much stuff (cause... well, I had to learn React, Redux and firebase in two days), but it does the job well. I will improve it without a doubt because it was very fun, even if I didn't have enough sleep (if you ask me, but I'm sure you won't). Anyway, it was a great experience!


### Features
